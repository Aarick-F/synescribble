# Project Description
The purpose of this project is utilizing Paper.js and Firebase to create a dynamically updated community gallery of in-browser drawings.
Paper.js allows a user to draw on the canvas element in HTML as point values.
Firebase stores all of the paths that are drawn on the canvas as well as the uer's name.
The ColorAPI pulls hex values that allows users to choose which color to use when drawing.
When the "Submit" button is clicked, the user's drawing is appended into the Gallery div, the data is pushed into Firebase and it is posted into Twitter with the use of the Twitter API.
